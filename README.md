# Project 1

Objective:

    Project started just as test how I could implement changing equipment with dynamic bodyparts.
    Afterwards I got some ideas and wanted to make it full game but project was interrupted by another project 
    so it was left unfinished.

Most important new things learned: 

    - Combining different meshes to same rig at runtime. (for changing armor)
    - First time creating my own pathfinding system
    - First time creating interactive UI. (inventory)
    - First time using Unityeditor scripts and scriptable objects. (for item and loot table editors)
    - First time using substance designer and substance painter for texture creation

Estimated project time line:

    started: late summer 2015
    ended: early september 2015

#Project 2

Objective:

    Turn based strategy game. This project was a part of a school assigment and had strict deadlines. 
    Project was left unfinished due to bad time estimations.

Most important new things learned: 

    - Working on tight schedules
    - Planning software architechture
    - Data serialization in Unity
    - Creating simple 3D models and animations with blender
    - 2D vector graphics for UI and particle effects
    - basics of LMMS for "music"

Estimated project time line:

    started: early september 2015
    ended: mid december 2015

#Project 3

Objective:

    Goal was to implement dark souls type of combat. All assets were downloaded from assetstore / mixamo.
    This project was made just to relax at christmas between two more important projects.

Most important new things learned: 

    - This project was one of the more animation heavy projects, so a lot of things learned about
    mechanim animation system

Estimated project time line:

    started: late december 2015

#Project 5

Objective:

    This game was made at finnish game jam 2016

Most important new things learned:

#Project 6

Objective:

    Made game with Processing in a team of 4 as lead programmer. This game was part of 
    Agile Software Development course. In the end, graphics, sounds and audio were also 
    on my responsibility. Enemy and animated effects were assets from opengameart.com 
    and other assets were made with Incscape/LMMS.

Most important new things learned: 

    - First time working in a team while using scrum for project management
    - Making vector graphics

Estimated project time line:

    started: january 2016
    ended: may 2016

#Project 7

Objective:

    This project started from inspiration gained thrugh reading about procedural 
    dungeon generation. My aim was to make roguelike game but I had some personal stuff 
    happening in summer so the progres was very slow. Eventually the project died out when 
    I was introduced to two talented 3d artist whom wanted to make a project with me.

Most important new things learned: 

    - Gained a lot of new information about different procedural generation techniques

Estimated project time line:

    started: june 2016
    ended: august 2016

#Project 8

Objective:

    This project was meant to be twin stick shootter game. We were team of 3 
    where my responsibility was to code everything and make visual effects(Particles, shaders etc.).
    In the end this project ended as we all had too much other things to do. Both artists 
    got work in game studios. I knew that in the beginning of 2017 we are doing bigger 
    game project for real client at school, so I couldn't commit to long lasting project.

Most important new things learned: 

    - Taking a lot more initiative and responsibility as team member
    - Started studying and making some simple shaders
    - Learned new techniques for producing good looking visual effects

Estimated project time line:

    started: august 2016
    ended: november 2016

#Project 9

Objective:

    I have been making weekly android games with libgdx from start of 2017 as part of 
    Mobile Game Programming course. This is latest weekly game where topic was using 
    box2d. I didn't create any assets for this game.

Most important new things learned: 

    - Using box2d for physics ans scene2d for UI

Estimated project time line:

    started: early march 2017
    ended: early march 2017
