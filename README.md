# Project 1

Objective:

    Project started as a test how I could implement changing equipment with dynamic bodyparts.
    Afterwards I got some ideas and wanted to make it full game but project was interrupted by another project 
    so it was left unfinished.

Most important new things learned: 

    - Combining different meshes to same rig at runtime. (for changing armor)
    - First time creating my own pathfinding system
    - First time creating interactive UI. (inventory)
    - First time using Unityeditor scripts and scriptable objects. (for item and loot table editors)
    - First time using substance designer and substance painter for texture creation

Estimated project timeline:

    started: late summer 2015
    ended: early september 2015

#Project 2

Objective:

    Turn based strategy/manager game. This project was a part of a school assignment for Software Design 
    course. Project was left unfinished due to bad time estimations.

Most important new things learned: 

    - Working to tight deadlines
    - Creating UML diagrams for software design
    - Serialization in Unity
    - Creating simple 3D models and animations with blender
    - 2D vector graphics for UI and particle effects

Estimated project timeline:

    started: early september 2015
    ended: mid december 2015

#Project 3

Objective:

    My goal was to implement dark souls type of combat. All assets were downloaded from assetstore / mixamo.
    This project was made just to relax at christmas between two more important projects.

Most important new things learned: 

    - This project was one of the more animation heavy projects, so I learned a lot of things about
    mechanim animation system

Estimated project timeline:

    started: late december 2015
    ended: late december 2015

    Project ended due to new game project starting at school.

Most important new things learned: 

    - Basics of procedural mesh generation 

Estimated project timeline:

    started: early january 2016
    ended: mid january 2016

#Project 6

Objective:

    This game was a part of Agile Software Development course. It was made with Processing 
    in a team of 4 where I worked as lead programmer. In the end, graphics, sounds and audio were also 
    on my responsibility. Enemy and animated effects were assets from opengameart.com and other assets 
    were made with Incscape/LMMS.

Most important new things learned: 

    - First time working in a team while using scrum for project management
    - Making vector graphics

Estimated project timeline:

    started: january 2016
    ended: may 2016

#Project 7

Objective:

    This project started from inspiration gained from reading about procedural 
    dungeon generation. My aim was to make roguelike game but I had some personal things 
    happening in summer, so the progress was very slow. Eventually the project died out when 
    I was introduced to two talented 3d artists whom wanted to make a project with me.

Most important new things learned: 

    - Gained a lot of new information about different procedural generation techniques

Estimated project timeline:

    started: june 2016
    ended: august 2016

#Project 8

Objective:

    This project was meant to be twin stick shootter game. We were team of 3 
    where my responsibility was to code everything and make visual effects(particles, shaders etc.).
    In the end this project ended as we all had too much other things to do. Both artists 
    got work in game studios. I knew that in the beginning of 2017 we are going to do bigger 
    game project for real client at school, so I couldn't commit to long lasting project.

Most important new things learned: 

    - Taking a lot more initiative and responsibility as a team member
    - Started studying and making some simple shaders
    - Learned new techniques for producing good looking visual effects

Estimated project timeline:

    started: august 2016
    ended: november 2016

#Project 9

Objective:

    I have been making weekly android games with libgdx from start of 2017 as a part of 
    Mobile Game Programming course. This is latest weekly game where the topic was using 
    box2d. I didn't create any assets for this game.

Most important new things learned: 

    - Using box2d for physics ans scene2d for UI

Estimated project timeline:

    started: early march 2017
    ended: early march 2017
