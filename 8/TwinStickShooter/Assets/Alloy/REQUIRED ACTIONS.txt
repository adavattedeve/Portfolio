ATTENTION: This version of Alloy adds the ability to disable all normal maps on a material for simple/background assets. This required adding a flag that has set normal maps to 'off' for all existing materials.

Please run the "Material Migrator" tool to fix your project's existing Alloy materials.

1.) Ensure that your project is saved and backed up.
2.) Go to the menu Window->Alloy->Material Migrator.
3.) After it finishes, hit Ctrl+S.
4.) Close and reopen Unity.
